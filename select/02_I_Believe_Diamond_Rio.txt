Every now and then,
Soft as breath upon my skin,
I feel you come back again,
And it's like you haven't been,
Gone a moment from my side
Like the tears were never cried
Like the hands of time are holding you and me

And with all my heart I'm sure,
We're closer than we ever were
I don't have to hear or see,
I've got all the proof I need
There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Now when you die your life goes on
It doesn't end here when you're gone
Every soul is filled with light,
It never ends and if I'm right,
Our love can even reach across eternity
I believe
Oh, I believe

Forever, you're a part of me
Forever, in the heart of me
I will hold you even longer if I can
Oh, the people who don't see the most,
Say that I believe in ghosts
If that makes me crazy, then I am,
'Cause I believe

Oh I believe

There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Every now and then,
Soft as breath upon my skin,
I feel you come back again,
And I believe
