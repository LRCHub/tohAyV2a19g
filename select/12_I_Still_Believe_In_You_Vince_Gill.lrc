[00:13.10] Everybody wants a little piece of my time
[00:19.90] But still I put you at the end of the line
[00:27.76] How it breaks my heart to cause you this pain
[00:34.53] To see the tears you cry fallin' like rain
[00:42.26] Give me the chance to prove
[00:49.52] And I'll make it up to you
[01:02.52] 
[00:55.45] I still believe in you
[01:02.25] With a love that will always be
[01:09.68] Standing so strong and true
[01:16.08] Baby, I still believe in you and me
[01:33.58] 
[01:34.96] Somewhere along the way, I guess I just lost track
[01:45.37] Only thinkin' of myself, never lookin' back
[01:52.66] For all the times I've hurt you, I apologize
[01:59.42] I'm sorry it took so long to finally realize
[02:07.11] Give me the chance to prove
[02:14.45] That nothing's worth losing you
[02:29.95] 
[02:21.04] I still believe in you
[02:26.98] With a love that will always be
[02:34.65] Standing so strong and true
[02:41.59] Baby, I still believe in you and me
[02:59.09] 
[03:03.52] Baby, I still believe in you
[03:09.58] With a love that will always be
[03:17.63] Standing so strong and true
[03:23.58] Baby, I still believe in you and me
